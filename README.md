# Project Overview

This project includes a RSS feed reader application as well as a set of tests based on jasmine.js to test the application's functionality.

## Usage

The lower part of the application shows the jasmine.js test overview and all the tests that have been defined in the 'jasmine/spec/feedreader.js' file. If all works correct, the tests should all pass.
